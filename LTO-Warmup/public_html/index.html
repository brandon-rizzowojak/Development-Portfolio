<p>A good warm up routine is vital to any musician and especially brass players. The muscles in the lips and face need to be warmed up to work properly playing the trumpet. If you want to have a nice sound and use the instrument for its music making abilities to full potential, you must have a good warm up.<br /><br />I've been using a method I call "Play, buzz, sing". It works by taking a note (or a sequence of notes) and playing them on the trumpet, then buzzing the same on the mouthpiece and finally singing the pitch or pitches. In between singing and buzzing, you need to use the trumpet to check if you drifted off pitch. Keep repeating singing or buzzing as long as you need to until you match the pitch on trumpet.<br /><br />One need not be an excellent vocalist for this method. No matter how undeveloped your voice is, this is about matching pitch, which is a fundamental musical protocol and achievable by anyone with a voice and ears. It's not about singing a song in front of people, just improving your sense of pitch on the trumpet. The playing and buzzing parts warm up important muscles and the entire method works together to get your trumpet mind going.</p>
<p>To get the most out of this routine, you have to make it exactly that - a routine! Everyday, warm up, if nothing else. Get your chops, ears and mind going - and the only way that really happens on a deep level is by doing it day in and day out.</p>
